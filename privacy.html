    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="tagline">
      Last updated: <span id="privacy-updated">2025-01-01</span><br />
      We care about your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how dMusic handles your data.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      dMusic is a personal music discovery app for iOS that lets you search for songs using Apple’s public
      iTunes Search API, listen to short preview clips, and save favourites and playlists.
      You can contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@dmusic.app">hello@dmusic.app</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What this policy covers</h2>
    <p>
      This policy explains how we handle personal data in:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the dMusic website (this site), and</li>
      <li>the dMusic iOS app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Website</h2>
    <p>
      This website is informational only. We do not:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>use cookies,</li>
      <li>run analytics scripts, or</li>
      <li>embed third-party trackers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you contact us by email, the contents of your message will be stored in our email provider for as long
      as reasonably necessary to respond and keep a basic record of communication.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data in the iOS app</h2>
    <p>
      To provide features like favourites and playlists, the dMusic app may store the following information in a
      secure backend (Supabase):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your email address (for authentication and login).</li>
      <li>A basic profile identifier.</li>
      <li>The tracks you mark as favourites.</li>
      <li>The playlists you create and the tracks inside them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not collect your contacts, precise location, photos, or other unrelated personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Music search & previews</h2>
    <p>
      When you search for music inside the app, your query is sent from your device to Apple’s public iTunes Search API
      to retrieve metadata (such as song name, artist, album artwork) and preview URLs.
    </p>
    <p>
      dMusic:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>does not use these searches to create profiles across apps or websites,</li>
      <li>only plays short preview clips provided by Apple, and</li>
      <li>is not affiliated with Apple Music or iTunes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Legal basis & purpose</h2>
    <p>
      We process your data only as needed to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>create and manage your account,</li>
      <li>sync favourites and playlists across your sessions, and</li>
      <li>secure the service (for example, prevent abuse or unauthorised access).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data retention & deletion</h2>
    <p>
      We keep your account data for as long as your dMusic account remains active.
      You can delete your account at any time directly from the app. When you delete your account:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>your account and associated favourites/playlists are deleted from our Supabase backend, and</li>
      <li>you are signed out of the app.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some minimal technical logs (for example, server logs) may be retained for a limited period for security,
      troubleshooting, and legal compliance, but they are not used to build user profiles.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children</h2>
    <p>
      dMusic is not directed at children under the age of 13. If you believe a child has created an account
      without appropriate consent, please contact us so we can remove the account.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top
      of this page. Significant changes may also be highlighted in the app or on the website.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how dMusic handles your data,
      please email <a href="mailto:hello@dmusic.app">hello@dmusic.app</a>.
